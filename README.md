# cs279-todo-app-svelte

This app is built with Svelte, a tool for building fast web applications. 
Most of the files are auto-generated, and the main functionality code I wrote 
can be found at todo-app/src/App.svelte

Use the following commands to run the app locally:
```
cd todo-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
